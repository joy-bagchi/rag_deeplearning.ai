    "In the context of RAG, vector embeddings are used for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Powering Search:**\n",
    "   - **Capturing Meaning:** Vector embeddings act like a map for text. They convert words and sentences into positions in vector space that capture meaning. These vectors can then be used to locate information matching a query.\n",
    "   - **Comparing Similarity:** When a prompt is received, it is converted into an embedding vector of its own. Then, the similarity between this prompt's vector and other vectors in the database can be calculated. This helps identify texts closest in meaning to the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Context:**\n",
    "   - **Context Matters:** They help in understanding the context of words in a query, ensuring that the best-matched information is found.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility:** Contextual embeddings allow for adapting to different meanings and capturing details that might otherwise be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, vector embeddings are a behind-the-scenes technology that facilitates smarter, more helpful, and accurate data retrieval by capturing nuances in a way that no other search technique provides."
